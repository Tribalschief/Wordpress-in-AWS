![Deployment Architecture](ws.webp)

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a WordPress website on an AWS EC2 instance with an Amazon RDS MySQL database. By following these steps, you will have a fully functional, scalable WordPress site running in the AWS cloud.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch an EC2 Instance
To host WordPress, we first need to set up an Amazon EC2 instance, which will act as our web server.

üîπ Steps to Create an EC2 Instance:
Log in to AWS and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Click ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù to start the setup.
Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
Choose Amazon Linux 2 (or any compatible Linux distribution).
Choose an Instance Type:
Select t2.micro, which is eligible for the AWS Free Tier.
Configure Instance Settings:
Set up networking, storage, and security groups.
Click ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù, select an SSH key pair, and deploy the instance.
Note: Download the key pair (.pem file) and keep it safe, as it is needed to access the server.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Apache Web Server on EC2
After launching the instance, we need to install Apache (HTTP Server) to serve our WordPress site.

üîπ Steps to Install Apache on EC2:
Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:

ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip
Switch to the root user:

sudo su
Update the package manager and install Apache:

yum update -y   # For Amazon Linux (use apt for Ubuntu)
yum install httpd -y
Start and enable Apache to run on boot:

service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
Verify that Apache is running by entering your EC2 public IP in a web browser.
If Apache is installed correctly, you should see the default Apache Test Page.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Download and Configure WordPress
Now that our web server is running, let's download and set up WordPress.

üîπ Steps to Install WordPress:
Move to the Apache web directory:

cd /var/www/html/
Download and extract the latest version of WordPress:

yum install wget -y
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
mv wordpress/* .
rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
Ensure the correct file permissions:

chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up AWS RDS MySQL Database
WordPress requires a database to store its content. We will create an Amazon RDS MySQL database.

üîπ Steps to Create an RDS MySQL Database:
Go to the AWS RDS Dashboard and click ‚ÄúCreate Database‚Äù.
Select MySQL as the database engine.
Choose "Free Tier" for the instance type.
Configure database settings:
Set Database Name: wordpress_db
Set Master Username: your_database_username
Set Password: your_database_password
Click ‚ÄúCreate Database‚Äù and wait for the RDS instance to be ready.
Find the RDS Endpoint:
Once the database is created, navigate to the RDS Dashboard.
Copy the Endpoint (RDS connection string).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Connect WordPress to the RDS Database
Now, we will configure WordPress to use the newly created RDS MySQL database.

üîπ Steps to Configure WordPress with RDS:
Navigate to the WordPress directory on EC2:

cd /var/www/html/
Rename the WordPress configuration file:

mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
Edit the wp-config.php file:

sudo nano wp-config.php
Update the following database configuration lines with your RDS details:

define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress_db' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'your_database_username' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'your_rds_endpoint' ); // Example: mydb-instance.xxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Save and close the file (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Complete the WordPress Installation
Once everything is configured, it's time to complete the WordPress setup.

üîπ Final Steps:
Open a web browser and enter your EC2 public IP.
You should see the WordPress installation wizard.
Follow the on-screen instructions to:
Set your site title.
Create an admin username and password.
Configure basic settings.
Click "Install WordPress".
Once installed, log in to your WordPress dashboard by visiting:

http://your-ec2-public-ip/wp-admin
üéâ Congratulations! Your WordPress site is live!
You have successfully: ‚úÖ Launched an EC2 instance
‚úÖ Installed Apache Web Server
